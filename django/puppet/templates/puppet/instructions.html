</p>

<p>Pay attention to the output, you will need the FQDN from the line that starts with <tt>Creating
    a new SSL key for</tt> as well as the certificate fingerprint from the line that starts with <tt>Info: Certificate
    Request fingerprint (SHA256):</tt>. Plug those values into the form below.</p>

<p>If the fingerprint is not displayed during the initial connection you can display it with <tt>{{ puppet.fingerprint }}</tt> .</p>

<p><b>NOTE: ALL Puppet commands MUST be run as root, either directly or with sudo or it WILL NOT WORK correctly.</b></p>

<hr/>

<p>If your only output is:</p>
<span class="pre console">Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled
</span><br/>

Then you need to clear out you Puppet client's SSL directory with <tt>{{ puppet.clear_certs }}</tt> and re-run the command.
